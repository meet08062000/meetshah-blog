Being humble is almost always hailed as a great virtue. Almost all religions, philosophers, thought leaders, successful people promote humility, and rightly so. But I want to take a different perspective today. The question I want to ask is, by being humble, are we really being humble? Or is it just a camouflage for our ego? This might sound ridiculous, but here me out and I might be able to change the way you look at humility.  

You might have noticed this.
