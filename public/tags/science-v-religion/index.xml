      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the first, second and third part, I would recommend you to first check those out and then come back here to read the part 4:
Teacher: Good morning students!
Students: Good morning teacher!
Teacher: Last time, Rajat had asked about rituals, let&amp;rsquo;s continue that discussion.
Rajat: Yes! I am fed up of my parents telling me to perform so many religious rituals.</description>

Teacher: Good morning students!
Students: Good morning teacher!
Teacher: Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with where we had ended in the last lecture. Jimit had asked us about the fake babas and gurus.
Jimit: Yes, I am of the opinion that paap, punya, heaven and hell are misused by these babas to fool innocent people.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the part-1, I would recommend you to first check that out and then come back here to read the part 2:
Teacher: Good morning students!
Students: Good morning teacher!
Teacher: I hope everyone remembers that we had started a debate in the last lecture, as far as I recall, Rohan had asked a question in the end which wasn&amp;rsquo;t answered because the bell rang.</description>

      <description>Whether you are on the atheist side or the theist side, you are wrong! The age old debate of science vs religion is still hot, and we all have faced it some day or another, here is my take on it in a dialogue form as a conversation between the students and teacher of a classroom:
Teacher: Good morning students!
Students: Good morning teacher!
Teacher: Let&amp;rsquo;s start the day with a prayer.</description>
