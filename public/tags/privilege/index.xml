      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about dreams today. Not the dreams that you see while sleeping. The dreams that keep you awake. The ones that motivate you to get out of bed and work. The ones that give you some purpose in life. We all have dreamt of something or the other. The dreams have been of different magnitudes based on the conditions around us and our age. For example, when I was in kindergarten, I used to dream that I will become the Prime Minister of India one day and all the criminals and &amp;ldquo;bad people&amp;rdquo; will run out of India.</description>

      <description>Nepotism is a very hot topic for people to throw hate towards these days. But in today&amp;rsquo;s blog I will prove it to you, that knowingly or unknowingly, we all perform actions and behave in ways which are nepotistic.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the basics. What is nepotism? Nepotism is basically an unfair advantage that a person gets because he/she knows someone who can help him/her achieve something he/she wants relatively easily.</description>
