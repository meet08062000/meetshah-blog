[{"content":"Today\u0026rsquo;s topic is controversial and it is something I have been thinking about lately. Can you achieve freedom by restricting yourself? Seems counter-intuitive, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Let me explain.\nLong back, our ancestors, the hunter gatherers, had a lot of freedom. They used to wander around in forests to collect food. They did not stay at one place for long. Then time passed by, we learned agriculture and we had to restrict ourselves to one location. We lost freedom of continuously moving from one location to another because our lifestyle demanded that we stay in one location. We restricted ourselves to a single location and we freed ourselves from the worry of \u0026ldquo;will I have to stay hungry tonight?\u0026rdquo;. You might be starting to get the point here.\nI feel that something very similar applies to a lot of places in life. Restrictions, I feel, are not always bad, they liberate us. This might seem very counter intuitive. But let me give you some examples. I was recently watching this video from Mark Manson\u0026rsquo;s youtube channel and he made a great point in the video. He said that once he was committed to his wife, he did not have to worry about \u0026ldquo;Oh my shirt has this stain, what will that girl think about me!\u0026rdquo;. The restriction to stay committed with a single person freed him from the constant worry of finding a potential partner.\nNow I want to make a clear distinction here. There are 2 kinds of restrictions. The first one is where someone else has imposed the restriction on you, you also want to impose that restriction on yourself but you (at least the some part of your brain) don\u0026rsquo;t like that restriction. The 2nd type of restriction is where someone imposes a restriction on you, and you are totally fine with it, even on an individual level, all the parts of your brain totally agree to it.\nA great example of the 1st type of restriction would be (for a lot of people) the restriction to drink or smoke. For a lot of people my age especially in India, parents are totally against drinking and smoking. In this case a person who is in their teenage or young adulthood feel the urge to drink or smoke. If they are very religious, they say this is a sin and restrict themselves from drinking, but there is a part of them telling them, \u0026ldquo;Nothing happens if you try once, see how much these people are enjoying themselves!\u0026rdquo;.\nAn example of the 2nd type of restriction would be the restriction to kill another person (at least under normal circumstances for a regular citizen). As ridiculous as it may sound, this is also a restriction. You don\u0026rsquo;t have the freedom to go around killing anybody you find in the way. But there is a distinction here with the first kind of restriction. You don\u0026rsquo;t have an urge to kill somebody. You have completely and willingly accepted and imposed that restriction on yourself, not just because of the fear of the consequences.\nThe kind of restriction I am talking about in this blog, is the second one. A lot of people ask me, how come you did not taste alcohol even once? You don\u0026rsquo;t see how much people enjoy? My very simple answer to that is, I have no urge to drink. Many people who come from a family where drinking is restricted have something like this going on in their mind when they are trying to drink for the first time, \u0026ldquo;Should I try? They seem to be enjoying themselves a lot, but what if my parents find out? Drinking is not good for health. I should not drink. But nothing happens if I try just one sip\u0026rdquo;. These kind of people are restricted, but not really free from the negative thoughts that come from either drinking or not drinking. For me, by restricting myself from drinking, I am free from worrying about all of these thoughts and even more, like \u0026ldquo;what will my friends think if I don\u0026rsquo;t drink, they will treat me like an outcast\u0026rdquo;. The 2nd kind of restriction is more like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care about drinking, or people\u0026rsquo;s opinions on whether I am drinking or not drinking\u0026rdquo;. Now, a lot of people will get me wrong here. I am not trying to be a moral police, drinking or not drinking is an individual choice. I am just trying to give an example to prove my point.\nI have realized that I have been applying this 2nd kind of restriction in many small places of my life. For example, whenever I go shopping with my mother, I just leave my shopping completely on her. I trust her that whatever she will buy will be good for me. In general, I do this for many topics I don\u0026rsquo;t care about, shopping being one of them.\nWith this logic, the \u0026ldquo;restricting yourself from bodily pleasures to achieve liberation\u0026rdquo; logic that many religions give does not seem that illogical (although it still feels somewhat far fetched to me). Freedom is a very complex and a heavily debated topic in philosophy. A lot of philosophers have thought a lot on the concept of freedom. Thinking about all this makes me a lot more curious to read those works from all those great philosophers.\nLet me leave you with this question. What is your definition of freedom? Do you think restrictions (type 2) can lead to freedom?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/achieve-freedom-by-restricting-yourself/","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s topic is controversial and it is something I have been thinking about lately.

But I haven\u0026rsquo;t always found this to be helpful. Working hard is important, there is no debating that. But I have a problem with how the whole self help industry, philosophers and motivational speakers portray it, and how we feel about it. This might be a little controversial. Allow me to explain.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you are working really hard towards something, it could be a promotion, or an exam, or getting that new client in your business, or whatever. For our example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you are working towards your promotion. You desperately want that promotion and that sweet appraisal. You are putting in 12 hours a day, you are listening to everything your boss says. You are completely exhausted when you come back home from office. Your daily routine - wake up, go to office, come back, sleep, repeat. Everyday morning you say to yourself, \u0026ldquo;I know you are working really hard, you just have to do this for 6 more months and you will get what you wanted!!\u0026rdquo;\nNow there are 3 probable outcomes here:\nYou hard work pays off, you get the result you wished so hard and the song starts playing in your head - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m unstoppable, I\u0026rsquo;m a Porsche with no breaks\u0026rdquo;. You don\u0026rsquo;t get promoted and you are completely depressed and angry. You don\u0026rsquo;t get promoted and regret that you did not work hard enough. In outcome 1 - you are really proud of yourself that you pulled this off. You worked so hard. You are so proud that you might let your ego take over. This may seem like an exaggeration, but speaking from personal experience, this happens when you are emotionally attached to the result (getting promoted in this case). And when we humans think that we have worked really hard towards something, we tend to emotionally attach ourselves to the result.\nSimilarly, for outcome 2 - you are completely dejected because you are so attached to it emotionally. You think you have worked really hard for this, you deserved this and still you did not get it.\nFor outcome 3 - this has happened to me a lot. I try to deal with this by thinking \u0026ldquo;control the controllables\u0026rdquo;. What is in the past is not in my control now. No point regretting it. Whenever there is the next opportunity, I will make sure to capitalize on it.\nSee, for outcome 1 and 2, working hard isn\u0026rsquo;t a problem. \u0026ldquo;Thinking\u0026rdquo; that you have worked really hard is the problem. There is a subtle difference. You are in a way \u0026ldquo;victimizing\u0026rdquo; yourself, \u0026ldquo;Oh I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through so much struggle for this, I deserve a reward!\u0026rdquo;. This is something very similar to a married person saying, \u0026ldquo;I have sacrificed so much for him/her, do I deserve that kind of a behaviour?\u0026rdquo;. The word \u0026ldquo;sacrifice\u0026rdquo; is the problem here. If you listen to the mainstream motivation, you will more likely than not, attach your emotions to your hard work.\nSomeone might object, that emotion is what makes them work hard in the first place. Another objection could be that you work for 12 hours a day for a year and you can\u0026rsquo;t even express emotion? What are you, a robot? These are completely valid arguments and I am not saying we detach ourselves to such an extent that we stop caring about the result. There is a need to find balance. Instead of saying, \u0026ldquo;I know it is hard, but I will have to do it, I will have to strive for the result\u0026rdquo;, say, \u0026ldquo;I have chosen to do this, toh kar lete hai naa, dikkat hi kya hai? (Let\u0026rsquo;s do it, what\u0026rsquo;s the problem?)\u0026rdquo;. Just a small change in the tone of the sentence will make so much difference in the way you will look at the result and your effort. In my experience, just this small change makes it so much easier to work hard without getting too attached emotionally.\nThere have been days when this did not work for me. I try to practice gratitude on those days. If you want to know more about practising gratitude, here\u0026rsquo;s a previous blog. Despite all of this, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help, I just let my emotions loose. You can cry in front of whoever you are comfortable, that helps a lot. All of this is during the \u0026ldquo;hard work\u0026rdquo; phase. On the result day, I try to think, whether I am successful or not, I am just satisfied with the effort. Then if I cross the line, I will be really happy obviously, but I try to not let my ego take over, as you guessed, by practising gratitude again. If I fail, I feel sad and I embrace sadness, not resist it. Then I try to think of what mistakes I made, was it controllable, if yes, \u0026ldquo;OK, Noted.\u0026rdquo;, if no, \u0026ldquo;bad luck, not everything can happen in my favour\u0026rdquo;.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s it for today\u0026rsquo;s blog. Just remember, a \u0026ldquo;dikkat kya hai\u0026rdquo; attitude solves 99% of your mental issues. Do let me know whether you agree or disagree with this blog, Will be waiting for your reactions and suggestions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-issue-with-hardwork/","summary":"We all have heard quotes like \u0026ldquo;you should work hard and your life will become easier\u0026rdquo; at least a million times by now.

During this election, I observed a few things with myself as well as others. A few things about what kind of people we generally tend to follow, what kind of people influence us, why do we get influenced by the people we do.\nThis election was all about people being either pro Modi or anti Modi. A few people said this is a dictatorship, a few people were completely in love with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mainstream media was either treating Modi like a God or a tyrant (I am including big youtubers in mainstream media, because nowadays they are). I observed a few interesting things with people who choose to follow one or the other. People are generally very stubborn in changing their beliefs. The people who view Modi as God won\u0026rsquo;t get convinced against their opinion no matter how much you try. Even clear facts and statistics won\u0026rsquo;t convince them against Narendra Modi. People who view him as a dictator have the same story. They always tend to agree with something that is in favour of their opinion and disagree with something that is against, no matter how valid the opposite arguments are or how dumb the supporting arguments are. This is called confirmation bias in psychology.\nThere is another separate group of people who follow some influencers or politcians and just because that influencer says something, no matter how invalid or half baked those arguments are, these followers don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any problem with them. They are convinced that whatever their favourite influencer or politician says is absolutely true. Adding fuel to the fire, social media algorithms keep on feeding you content that further polarizes your thought.\nThis is not just true with politics. People have very strong opinions on a lot of things. I have seen a lot of people so convinced that people of some other religion are evil. People have strong opinions on whether to settle abroad or not. There are communities in India where it is seen as a matter of pride if you go to the US to study or work and a matter of shame if you don\u0026rsquo;t. There are people who are completely against people of a different race. There are vegetarians and vegans who think non vegetarian people are evil. There are theists who think atheists are dumb and vice versa. Polarizing movies and social media further exacerbate the situation. Polarization is everywhere.\nI also feel a lot of this polarization also comes from branding and marketing. There are companies which have built a cult like following and people just want the brand name without even having a look at the actual product. There are people in India who are completely brainwashed by this marketing that foreign countries are so much better than India.\nNow don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. Not everyone is trying to polarize. There are some genuinely good people who are doing great work out there. Only thing we have to do is to follow the right people. Don\u0026rsquo;t get influenced by false or incomplete arguments that are polarizing. Try to follow people who are neutral, who show you both the positives and the negatives of something or someone. Try to get opposite viewpoints on everything and then form your opinion. Critical thinking is really important in this social media age.\nIt is really easy to get into the trap of these people because they generally try to exploit an emotion within you. That emotion could be related to something you have experienced in the past. It could be something you are currently experiencing. The things you experience in your childhood matter a lot. Those experiences shape your opinions, your beliefs, your likes and dislikes. The places where you stop thinking rationally and start thinking emotionally are the places where confirmation bias or authoritative bias can take over. It is really difficult to get out of it.\nAs always, introspection is a really good way to get out of it. As the famous quote goes.\nKnowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.\n-Aristotle\nTo know more on introspection, check out one of my previous blogs.\nSo that was today\u0026rsquo;s blog. This was a short one. Just wanted to share my observations based on the elections. Hope you enjoyed it and found value. Thankyou for reading and stay tuned for more!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/on-polarization/","summary":"With the election season in India over, I have a few thoughts.

Not the dreams that you see while sleeping. The dreams that keep you awake. The ones that motivate you to get out of bed and work. The ones that give you some purpose in life. We all have dreamt of something or the other. The dreams have been of different magnitudes based on the conditions around us and our age. For example, when I was in kindergarten, I used to dream that I will become the Prime Minister of India one day and all the criminals and \u0026ldquo;bad people\u0026rdquo; will run out of India. Now obviously that is ridiculous. All of us have had some ridiculous dreams when we were young. But we have had some serious dreams as well. I had a dream college. I wanted to go to IIT. I tried to achieve it and failed. That hurts. But what about the dreams I already achieved? What about the dreams YOU already achieved?\nMy life today, is the dream life of my 19-20 year old self. My dream was to get a good package in a reputed company and to get my career off to a flying start. But does it feel like that today? Not really. Why is it that when you achieve something, that you wanted so desperately some time back, does not feel that big of a deal now? I don\u0026rsquo;t feel as energized and excited as I was going to the office for the first time. Let me give you another example. Back in 2016, I had just completed my 10th standard and I was very excited to get my hands on my first smartphone. I still remember, for the initial few days, I used to take care of it as if it was a new born baby. But then, after some time, it did not feel that good. It just became my phone. Not the phone I was so excited about, just \u0026ldquo;my phone\u0026rdquo;.\nA friend of mine had a dream to get into a FAANG company. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FAANG stands for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. These companies are top tier companies to get job as a software engineer. He studied hard, really hard. After a lot of hardwork, he was finally able to achieve it. He was placed in Amazon. He was dancing like crazy when he received the email that he was selected. But if you see him today, he treats it as if it is such a normal thing, \u0026ldquo;why is everyone so obsessed about me getting into Amazon? It is not that big of a deal.\u0026rdquo; This happens in every aspect of life. Even when you see someone beautiful/handsome for the first time and you have a crush on them, it all seems so beautiful. It seems like wow if I get to date them, I will be the happiest person in life. But relationships get boring pretty quickly if efforts are not put in.\nObsessing over what we don\u0026rsquo;t have and then taking for granted what we have and then obsessing over something new is the endless cycle that almost all of us are trapped in. This cycle leads to most of the mental and emotional issues we face throughout our life. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say your dream phone is an iPhone, you see all the celebrities carry iPhone, you see many of your friends have bought an iPhone, you start feeling jealous of the people owning an iPhone, you start having an inferiority complex because you have a cheap phone and most of the people around you have an iPhone. See, I am not saying that having a wish to buy an iPhone is bad. Your dreams motivate you to perform and make yourself better. The problem is the obsession and all the negative emotions that come out of it. So what is the way out of it? Well there is no single correct answer to it. I am no expert at it, but I would like to share what has worked for me.\nIf you have read the part 5 of my blog series \u0026ldquo;The Secret to Never Ending Happiness\u0026rdquo;, the things that I have mentioned in there have worked well for me. I find myself obsessing less over small things. I have also implemented the things mentioned in part 3 of \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite!\u0026rdquo; to improve at reducing the number of factors that affect my mind and the weightage of each individual factor. The \u0026ldquo;Karm kiye jaa, fal ki chinta mat kar\u0026rdquo; phrase has worked really well for me.\nTo tackle the 2nd problem, the \u0026rsquo;taking for granted\u0026rsquo; problem, I practice gratitude. I consciously try to be grateful to all the things that I have got in life. I mentioned this in We are all nepotistic. We all are privileged in some or the other way. If we learn to practice gratitude, we start to appreciate the things we have in life rather than taking them for granted and that solves the \u0026lsquo;obsessing over the dream\u0026rsquo; problem as well. Our attitude becomes something like this: \u0026ldquo;Although I don\u0026rsquo;t have it, I am happy. I will strive for it, if I get it, that\u0026rsquo;s great! I have one more thing to add to the long list of privileges I already have. But even if I don\u0026rsquo;t get it, I will be happy and content with my effort.\u0026rdquo;\nSo that was today\u0026rsquo;s blog. Hope you enjoyed it.

We can identify those factors by self evaluation or introspection. That is precisely what we are going to discuss in today\u0026rsquo;s blog. So what is introspection? I would define introspection as thinking deeply about your own thoughts, ideas and feelings and examining them. Although the definition of introspection is accurate, but it does not help. It is not an easy process and the definition itself is not helpful to cultivate its habit. Now you would ask why bother to introspect? There are tons of advantages of introspection. It helps you boost self-awareness, improve your decision making, enhances your mental wellbeing, sparks personal growth, I could go on and on about this. So let\u0026rsquo;s delve into this extremely important and underrated topic with a few examples.\nRahul, an aspiring software engineer is preparing for his interview that is scheduled tomorrow. Rahul is a very bright and talented programmer, but he is anxious today. \u0026ldquo;What if I don\u0026rsquo;t clear the interview tomorrow?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Will they like me?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What if I blunder a simple question?\u0026rdquo;. Most of us have been through a similar situation some time or the other in our lives. Now Rahul, being so anxious, reaches out to his mentor, a professor from his college, to seek guidance. The professor is aware of the ability Rahul has but is worried about his anxiety. He tells Rahul to sit down and close his eyes.\nProfessor: What is going on in your mind?\nRahul: I am anxious!\nProfessor: Why?\nRahul: Due to tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s interview.\nProfessor: No issues. This is completely normal, everyone goes through this. Now answer these questions. Have you studied all the subjects thouroughly?\nRahul: Yes, I have.\nProfessor: Have you researched about the company, their values, etc.?\nRahul: Yes.\nProfessor: Are you aware of everything in your resume and will you be able to speak about anything questioned within the resume?\nRahul: Yes, I think so.\nProfessor: Great. Then you have done everything that was in your control, now there are just 2 things left to do. Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself down and listen to me carefully. You were the class topper for 5 out of 8 semesters in college. You won 1st prize in multiple hackathons and have very good ratings in competitive coding. You know very well you have the ability to clear the interview. So just go there with calm nerves and don\u0026rsquo;t think about the results. Whatever the results might be, you know you have done well!\nRahul: Thanks professor! That was helpful, I feel calmer now.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at another example.\nSam, an artist, follows Laura, another artist on instagram. Laura and Sam had studied from the same college but Laura had 10000+ followers whereas Sam had just around 2000. He saw that Laura had posted a photo of a new painting of her and she was getting a lot of likes and comments and everybody was appreciating her. Sam also posted a photo and did not get as many likes. He was furious. \u0026ldquo;Why do her paintings get so much attraction, mine are better!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How come we start from the same place and she is so much more successful! I used to get better grades at almost everything in college.\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t know what is wrong with people these days. They like her painting over mine?!\u0026rdquo;.\nOne day, Sam discussed this with his mother. And his mother shut him up saying that he is jealous. \u0026ldquo;Stop crying like a baby and focus on improving yourself rather than being jealous!\u0026rdquo;, were the exact words of his mother. Those words deeply hurt Sam. He was angry with his mother. \u0026ldquo;How could she do that to me?\u0026rdquo;. Once his anger cooled down. He started realizing it. \u0026ldquo;What is my issue?\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;I am jealous!\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Because Laura is more popular than I am.\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Is that correct? Should I be jealous?\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;No I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t!\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;But why is she more popular? Is it because her paintings are actually better? May be. Let me examine them once again with an open mind. Yes they are actually really good.\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;What can I learn from them?\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;I will improve my paintings and congratulate and thank Laura for inspiring me.\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Also, 2000 followers is also not a small number! I should be grateful to those 2000 people who appreciate my talent!\u0026rdquo;.\nYou might have noticed a pattern here. It is always about understanding and rationally acknowledging (which is very important) what emotion you are going through. Then figuring out \u0026lsquo;Why\u0026rsquo;. Then working towards improving it without judgement. This is the entire process of introspection. In the first example, instead of the professor, it should be you yourself, because not many people have great mentors like the professor. Making introspection a habit is the most useful skill you can learn in your entire life. It will help you identify your flaws, and fix them. It will help you understand yourself better. It will help you become a little bit better everyday.\nIntrospection is a topic I personally have deep interest in and we will cover it a little bit more in future episodes, so if you liked this one, stay tuned for the next ones. Until then, goodbye!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-solution-to-most-of-your-problems/","summary":"In the part 5 of my blog series \u0026ldquo;The Secret to Never Ending Happiness\u0026rdquo;, I had ended by saying that most of the people don\u0026rsquo;t even know what are the factors that affect their state of mind.

But in today\u0026rsquo;s blog I will prove it to you, that knowingly or unknowingly, we all perform actions and behave in ways which are nepotistic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start from the basics. What is nepotism? Nepotism is basically an unfair advantage that a person gets because he/she knows someone who can help him/her achieve something he/she wants relatively easily. There are countless examples of nepotism everywhere around you, employees of a company, owners of a business, actors in the film industry, college and school admissions via management quota, etc. On the face of it, it seems very unfair to take away opportunity from people deserving it and giving it to someone who was just lucky to be in the right place and the right time.\nBut now, let\u0026rsquo;s look at it from another angle. I will give you an example of my own life. I currently work as a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase. I was able to get a good CGPA, was able to develop my skills, clear the interview rounds and secure a good job. Now on the face of it, you will say that this is completely based on my merit, and you will be correct to say that, but you cannot deny the fact that there is a lot of luck involved in this. I got into a decent college because I could score good marks in my MH-CET exams. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, MH-CET is the entrance exam for engineering colleges in Maharashtra. Why was I able to score good marks in MH-CET? Because I decided to give JEE in my 12th Standard. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world. I was able to clear JEE but not with enough marks to secure a seat in top engineering colleges in India. But as a side effect of studying JEE, MH-CET exam became very easy for me, so I secured good marks and got into a decent college in Mumbai. Getting into a decent college was key. Because the peer group you have in college matters a lot.\nNow you will say, \u0026lsquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see any signs of nepotism here\u0026rsquo;. Let me answer that for you. There are multiple levels of luck involved here. I was able to study in school because my parents had the willingness as well as ability to pay for the school fees. I decided to study JEE just because a lot of people did that and it was considered prestigious to study in IIT. Again my parents had the ability and willingness to finance the high fees the JEE classes as well as engineering colleges charged. As a result of all these coincidences, I was able to get into a good college where I found a good peer group which led to me staying motivated to study and get a good job. And I haven\u0026rsquo;t even mentioned the fact that I was born in Mumbai, an urban location with abundance of opportunities and awareness among people. I haven\u0026rsquo;t even mentioned how big of a role genetics has played in this. Whatever abilities I have, a significant portion of it is just because I am my parents\u0026rsquo; child. I haven\u0026rsquo;t even considered the fact that I was born healthy, without any physical or mental disability.\nIf a person with the same potential as mine, did not have parents who could finance their education. Or if their parents did not have enough awareness to put their child in school. Or if he/she had to get married early and have kids before having enough money just because that is the culture in their village, they would not have been in the place I am. Everybody in this world has an unfair advantage. In my case it is being born in a city with many opportunities, having parents who were willing and able to fund my education and a series of decisions that went right to bring me where I am. You, the reader of this blog is lucky enough to be in a place where you have internet and you are able to read these blogs.\nNow you will argue that this is not nepotism, there is merit involved here. To answer that, bollywood actors like Ranbir Kapoor are children of previous actors and directors, but since their acting has merit, their movies earn money and they get appreciation. Businessmen like Mukesh Ambani or any big family run businesses in India are all nepotistic, but all of them have merit, and that\u0026rsquo;s why they don\u0026rsquo;t get as much criticism. Merit is needed anywhere you go. The only difference between a rich person\u0026rsquo;s child is only that the unfair advantage you have is different from the unfair advantage they have.\nNow in no way am I saying that I support nepotism that is done with the intention to bring down people with genuine merit, I would love the world to be a total meritocracy. But the problem is, that is not possible. So appreciate the privileges you have got in life, look to improve yourself instead of complaining about privileges someone else has got. Because you as well are nepotistic.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/we-are-all-nepotistic/","summary":"Nepotism is a very hot topic for people to throw hate towards these days. But in today\u0026rsquo;s blog I will prove it to you, that knowingly or unknowingly, we all perform actions and behave in ways which are nepotistic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start from the basics. What is nepotism? Nepotism is basically an unfair advantage that a person gets because he/she knows someone who can help him/her achieve something he/she wants relatively easily.","title":"We are all nepotistic"},{"content":"This is the part 3 of the \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite!\u0026rdquo; series. In part 1, we understood that every person is a hypocrite. In part 2, we got a bit of insight about the irrational and rational part of our mind. In this part, let\u0026rsquo;s explore a beautiful way of controlling your mind and using it to your own advantage.\nI was reading this beautiful book recently called Energize Your Mind by Gaur Gopal Das. The book covers a wide range of topics, including stress management, overcoming negative thoughts, building positive habits, and finding meaning and purpose in life. There is a chapter in the book titled \u0026lsquo;Joshua slips away\u0026rsquo;. I really love the way an analogy is established between our mind and a child. To summarize that chapter, it is about an experience of Gaur Gopal Das ji at the London airport where a really young child named Joshua is lost and his family is completely panicked and they are unable to find the child and everyone present there is searching for the child. Later they find that the child playing near the fountain. So Gaur Gopal Das ji say that, our mind is also like Joshua. Do check out the book if you want to read what he said in detail. In this blog, I will give you my own interpretation of this.\nIn the last blog, I had shared a survey where I had asked a few really basic level questions about parenting. Based on the answers you have given, turns out most of you are already familiar how to introspect and make yourself better! The only thing you need to know is how similar it is to raising a child. This might sound a bit confusing at first. How is raising a child and introspecting analogous? Well, let me give you some examples so you can better understand.\nImagine a child who is throwing a tantrum because he/she does not want to eat medicine. How do you handle the child? One option is to incentivize the child. For eg: \u0026ldquo;If you eat this medicine, you will become strong and intelligent like Iron Man!\u0026rdquo;. Another option is fear. For eg: \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t eat this medicine, Doctor uncle will have to give you an injection! Let me tell him to bring the injection\u0026rdquo;. Now imagine the time from your student days when you were trying so hard to study, but you weren\u0026rsquo;t able to. Your mind was throwing tantrums. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to study, this is so boring!\u0026rdquo;, the mind says. You have 2 options, incentive or fear. You tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;Study for one more day and I will pass with flying colors!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;If I don\u0026rsquo;t study, I will fail!\u0026rdquo;. Now this was a relatively simple example but I hope you can see the analogy.\nThe only real difference between the 2 situations is the involvement of the word \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s the single word where everything falls apart. All our biases, complexes, emotions and our hypocrisy come into picture and rationality goes out of the window. The secret is to treat your mind as a separate individual entity like your child and not like yourself. Use the word \u0026lsquo;You\u0026rsquo; instead of \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;.\nLet me give you one more example. You all might have noticed this. Young children tend to cry when they are hungry. They also tend to cry when no one is giving them attention or they just want to throw a tantrum because something did not go their way. A mother more often than not understands what is going on in the baby\u0026rsquo;s mind, whether it is hungry or is just throwing a tantrum and no action is needed as such. Your mind as well throws tantrums, does things that holds you back because it is not comfortable. Your mind also cries when it is in real pain. You need to be the mother of your mind and understand what is the situation right now, and behave accordingly.\nNow some of you readers might think that when does the mind throw a tantrum? Procrastination of some work is a simple example of that. You know very well that the work needs to be done, but just because your mind feels like not doing it, it throws a tantrum and you end up delaying the work. When does the mind genuinely need help (child is hungry)? For example, you have gone through a breakup recently, you have failed an exam recently, you have lost a family member recently, you were laid off from your job recently, there are countless examples. These are things where the mind genuinely needs your help. If you are a workaholic person, your mind genuinely needs rest but you constantly keep it running. Just like a very strict parent constantly scolding their child and not giving the love or pampering they require in times of need.\nTo face this world, you need to make your child tough, only pampering won\u0026rsquo;t work. Similarly, constantly listening and reacting/obeying to all the tantrums that your mind throws at you will make you a weak person and you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to succeed in life. So next time you see an iPhone commercial and are tempted to buy it without having the budget, think of it like your child is throwing a tantrum because you are not buying him/her an unaffordable toy when he/she has many toys already.\nIn case you are curious, here are the survey responses. Most of you have selected that you should sometimes pamper a child but not always, sometimes praise a child but not always, sometimes scold your child but not always. Similarly, you should sometimes pamper your mind, for eg, take a cheat meal in your diet plan but not always, sometimes praise your mind so you don\u0026rsquo;t get underconfident, but praising always will lead to overconfidence and ego, sometimes scold your mind for behaviours it should not have engaged into, give the mind everything that it requires but not everything that it asks for, similar to your child.\nParenting is a skill and so is handling your mind. And like any other skill, this can be mastered by continuous and persistant practice. I hope that all of us become expert at this one day. This brings an end to my \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite\u0026rdquo; series, hope you enjoyed it! Do let me know your thoughts in the comments section below. Will meet you in the next blog with a new topic. Until then, bye-bye!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-a-hypocrite-3/","summary":"This is the part 3 of the \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite!\u0026rdquo; series.

In part 1, we understood that every person is a hypocrite when it comes to matters that affect their own self. Their behavior in both the cases are very different. In this part, let\u0026rsquo;s explore why that happens.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a scenario where you are watching the iPhone 15 advertisement and your salary is 25000 INR a month, you have just received your 1st salary and you are 22 years old. The following goes through your mind:\nWow!! Just look at these iPhone camera samples! They look beautiful! How much does it cost? (You go to amazon and check the current price, it shows 1,00,000 80,000). Oh wow! 20,000 INR discount! Sweet. This is totally worth the money! But my salary is just 25000. How will I afford this\u0026#x1f61e;? Wait a minute! EMI! Let me check how much is the EMI! 13333 INR for 6 months no cost EMI! This is a nice offer.\nBut is it a good purchase? It gives me such good photos, videos and performance, but is it really worth the price? I can\u0026rsquo;t really afford an iPhone.\nYes obviously it is worth the price! Along with all those features, it gives me something to flaunt. After all, iPhones are associated with status in India. How would it look like when all my friends are using an iPhone and I am the only one stuck with an android phone? Although I can\u0026rsquo;t afford the iPhone fully, but I will easily be able to afford the EMI. And anyways no cost EMI is a good thing right? I am not paying any extra charge for it. Okay I have decided to buy it.\nThese are the typical thoughts that go through our head when we are trying to make a decision for ourselves. Not necessarily everyone thinks in the same way in the above scenario, but we all think in the same way in some or the other scenario. In my opinion, this is what exactly happens in such scenarios. We don\u0026rsquo;t have one mind. We have 2. 1st one is the rational and logical mind, and 2nd is the irrational mind. This push-and-pull between the rational and irrational is what makes us uniquely human.\nThere is a constant tussle going on between your irrational and rational mind. In the above case, the rational mind comes into play when you think whether the iPhone is really worth the price? The irrational mind wins in this case. Often in such decisions, or a few other thoughts for that matter (like the example given at the beginning of the previous blog), we tend to let the irrational brain win. And that is completely natural. But sometimes this can affect us adversely.\nSometimes we let the irrational mind win to such an extent that we start rationalizing it. Like in the above example, although the rational mind knew that this purchase is not justified, we found a way to rationalize it by status symbol and no cost EMI. As famously quoted by James Harvey Robinson:\nMan is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider another example where the irrational brain wins over the rational. You are a musician and you get an opportunity to perform in an event called XYZ in Mumbai. This is a huge event, big stars and businessmen will come to watch you perform live. You are excited and book tickets to fly to Mumbai. You prepare really hard, you are totally ready for the big day. But as the day nears, your anxiety kicks in. Your fear that things might go wrong grows day by day. You invent excuses - work deadlines, sudden illnesse, even car trouble - to justify backing out. You end up cancelling your trip, missing out on the valuable opportunity you craved. You are guilty and disappointed. This can have long term effects on your career development.\nThis scenario is not uncommon. Fear of failure, social anxiety, etc. can often trigger the irrational mind to sabotage our goals and aspirations. So it is really important to keep your irrational mind in check, because if that goes out of control, it has the potential to ruin your life.\nNow, having said that, it is important to understand that the irrational mind is not evil. It is as important as the rational mind. After all that is what makes us human. To deny either side of this spectrum is to deny the richness of our experience. The rational alone can leave us cold and calculating, while the irrational unchecked can lead us down paths of chaos and delusion.\nThe art of mastering your mind is to understand when to use the rational mind and when to let the irrational mind take control. There is no specific set of guidelines to this as each person is different, their choices are different, their situations, abilities and conditions are different. But it is the process that is more important than the choices we make. So, the next time you find yourself caught between a logical decision and an emotional urge, remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not a battle to be won, but a tango to be mastered.\nSo this was part 2 of the series \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite!\u0026rdquo;. Hope you enjoyed it and gained some value from it. In the next blog, we will explore a way of self introspection that I really love. But for that I will like to get a response from you on this survey. Filling this form won\u0026rsquo;t take much of your time, it consists of 5 really straight forward questions. So please keep in mind to fill this survey before watching the next blog whenever it comes out. There are some really interesting things coming up in the next one based on the survey. Stay tuned!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-a-hypocrite-2/","summary":"This is the part 2 of the \u0026ldquo;You are a hypocrite!\u0026rdquo; series.

Is it about me? Are they talking about the fumble I had in the presentation? OMG yes they are talking about it. Let me get closer to them so I can listen.\u0026rdquo; (Heart rates rising). \u0026ldquo;Oh mannnn! I still can\u0026rsquo;t hear anything.\u0026rdquo; (The 3 people keep laughing and the go off to their desks and continue their work). \u0026ldquo;F**k man, it better be something unrelated. But what if it isn\u0026rsquo;t? December is approaching. What if my manager gives a bad feedback about me. What if I don\u0026rsquo;t get promoted this year? Does he have a grudge on me? Oh God I am screwed.\u0026rdquo; One of the 3 people who were discussing earlier comes to you and asks, \u0026ldquo;Hey you saw that client\u0026rsquo;s face when you were presenting? That was so funny, we were discussing about that, I was trying so hard not to laugh!\u0026rdquo;. You heave a sigh, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, that was so funny!\u0026rdquo;.\nThe above scene describes a situation from a first person perspective. Now let\u0026rsquo;s see this other way round:\nA really close friend of yours walks up to you, and tells you, \u0026ldquo;Hey bro! I think I am screwed, my manager has a grudge on me, I think I will be fired. What will I do?\u0026rdquo;. You ask him what happened and he says, \u0026ldquo;They were discussing something and laughing very hard. And just before that I had fumbled in my presentation. I have made way to many mistakes this year and so I don\u0026rsquo;t think my manager sees me fit for this job\u0026rdquo;. You start laughing really hard, \u0026ldquo;You dumbass! Just because they are discussing something and laughing, you assume all of this? Nothing\u0026rsquo;s going to happen, just shut the thoughts and focus on work, December\u0026rsquo;s coming\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat can we understand from the above 2 scenarios? Both the scenarios were essentially the same. While reading this blog, you might feel that isn\u0026rsquo;t this a bit of a stretch? Who overthinks that much? But believe me, we all do. Not necessarily in this same exact scenario, but in some scenario or the other, we all overthink. There is a constant swirl of emotions and thoughts that go on in our mind each and every second. We deal with all the nonsense and chatter in our brain every single second.\nAn even more important question is, when the situation is same, why is our behaviour different in both the scenarios? If we are telling our friend to stay relaxed and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to worry, why aren\u0026rsquo;t we able to think in the same way when the same situation comes upon us? Aren\u0026rsquo;t we all a bunch of hypocrites?\nHypocrites are people who don\u0026rsquo;t practice what they preach. If we preach that this isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue, why don\u0026rsquo;t we practice it when the same problem comes upon us? Are we doing it on purpose? No we are not. It is basic human nature to imagine the worst possible scenarios and stay fixated on them, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the scenarios are real or imaginary. We are just too conservative when it comes to some problem that is related to ourselves.\nSo what do we do about this hypocrisy? Do we try to thwart it? Is this hypocrisy wrong? How do we deal with it? Let\u0026rsquo;s consider this, what is the basic issue here? The only difference between scenario 1 and scenario 2 is the perspective. We can conclude one thing from this, humans tend to be rational when it comes to problems of other people (at least the people they care about) and irrational when it comes to problems about oneself. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider one more example here, I have used this example in this blog, but it is equally applicable here. When I appeared for my JEE Mains examination, I was convinced that my exam went bad because I did not get a clock. It had nothing to do with my preparation, I was furious. But my parents told me that it was my lack of preparation that led to this, they were thinking rationally. I was thinking irrationally. I would have said the same if I were in their place.\nIf you try to think, there are thousands of examples of you as well as people around you behaving in an irrational way when a situation is about them and in a rational way when the situation is about someone else. It can be a really small situation like let\u0026rsquo;s say buying an iPhone and it can go as big as you can imagine. And the most intriguing part is, we even come up with reasons for each and every irrational thought that comes up in our mind. Those reasons are equally irrational, but they can convince us. For example, while buying an iPhone in India when a person can\u0026rsquo;t afford it, they make up a lot of excuses like, \u0026ldquo;It is a status symbol\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The EMI is so low I can easily afford it\u0026rdquo;.\nHumans are emotional and it is very important to manage these emotions well to live a good life. Be it financially, physically or mentally. So how do we manage these emotions? The answer is self introspection. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we will try to figure out in this blog series. I am no expert at it, and I am as vulnerable as you are to these irrational thoughts, but nothing wrong to together try to improve right?\nStay tuned for the next blog where we explore the mysteries that lie in the universe within us, our mind. Until next time, remember, it is natural to be a hypocrite!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-a-hypocrite-1/","summary":"All humans are hypocrites; the biggest hypocrite of all is the one who claims to detest hypocrisy.\n\u0026ndash; Peter Wastholm\nScene: You are in the office and you see 2 colleagues and your manager talking and laughing at something.\n\u0026ldquo;What would they be talking about?

If you are here for the first time, please make sure to check out the part 1, part 2, part 3 and part 4 and then come back here. Now without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s get into it straightaway.\nThe above diagram is a representation of everything that we have learnt in the first 4 blogs. The fp boxes represent the factors in life that affect the state of mind positively and the fn boxes represent the negatively affecting factors. All of these factors are different for different people. The y-axis in the diagram represents a spectrum of emotions we experience. Each factor is placed based on how it affects the state of mind in the absence of other factors. Think of all the arrows that go from the mind to the factors like the factors are pulling the mind towards the emotion they are in. The labellings wp1\u0026hellip;wpn and wn1\u0026hellip;wnn are the weights or kind of the force by which these factors pull the mind to their emotion. These weights are variable. All these factors are everything we have ever experienced in life. Every little and every large thing. These factors contain all our fears, all our abilities, all our success, all our failures, all our biases and everything you can possibly think of. It includes small annoying things like your barber spoiling your hairstyle, small happiness like the food being tasty, extreme happiness like becoming a parent for the first time. The diagram here is a very simplified version of what I am trying to explain and not all emotions are covered here but you get the point. Our state of mind at any point in time is determined by a weighted average of all these factors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say it is rainy season and a speeding car passing by splashes water all over you, that creates a new factor to affect your state of mind and since it is very recent, the weight for that factor or the force by which it pulls your mind towards the angry emotion is very high, you get instantly triggered by such an event. The weight of this factor becomes very high and it kind of wins the tussle between all the positive and negative emotions in your mind and drags your mind into the angry column. So we constantly get into situations where our mind (which is a function of all the factors already present and their corresponding weights) gets a new factor (a new puller) with some weight of its own (which is generally high for recent factors). We react to the new factor (new situation) based on our previous state of mind.\nNow, consider an ideal religious monk, who has left behind all worldly pleasures. What factors do they have that affect their state of mind? Money? Career? Business? Love? None of that. They have just 2 factors. God and sprituality. Both of these factors places their state of mind firmly in the \u0026lsquo;satisfied/content\u0026rsquo; row in the y-axis. We are talking about an ideal monk here. But real monks are still humans, so they still do have a lot of factors, a lot less than us in quantity and their weights are pretty insignificant when we compare them to religion, God and spirituality. Which even though not being an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; monk, places their state of mind firmly in the satisfied category. Do you think there is any other person who is as happy as them then? You would argue that people do stay extremely happy in some parts of life which is higher then satisfied or content. But what would you prefer? Satisfied and content all the time vs extremely happy for a very small amount of time along with all the accompanied negative emotions? You might agree to this and might not. You might think that how can someone be happy with such boring stuff. You\u0026rsquo;d think that there are so many good things to do in life, \u0026ldquo;you live only once\u0026rdquo;, etc. But you will agree to the point that they are in a really good state of mind. Although not in a way you would like, but still, that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of state of mind everyone wants to reach, not necessarily with those factors.\nNow don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I am not telling you to become a monk yourself and leave everything. I am just telling you to learn from them. How do you bring that kind of happiness in your life? Let\u0026rsquo;s take notes from the monk model. First, a heavy weight satisfying factor. Second, less number of factors. Third, less weight to all the other factors. Now, for the first one, it is really difficult to find a single factor that can keep you satisfied always and be so heavy weight that it can overrule all the other factors like religion and spirituality for monks. Along with all of this, that factor should not do any harm to you and should always be rewarding and should never cause sadness because the weight we are giving it is very high, we cannot afford for it to drag our mind to the depressed zone. Let\u0026rsquo;s see, what could that factor be? It cannot be money, sex, career, or even small things like food, travelling, etc. This is because all of that can either lead to sadness or be dangerous at times. Could it be family, or any other kind of relationship, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend or even friends? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so because one day if we have a fight with them, we will lose our happiness. You see the point here? It is really hard to find a single factor that dictates your state of mind, the monks have found that factor which has made it really easy for them to maintain a good state of mind. So what is that factor for you? That is for you to realize really. Do I know what is that factor for me? Frankly, no. Will I ever be able to figure that out? I don\u0026rsquo;t know that too. But at least I know where to start. And I will share that with you.\nYou can start with the 2nd and the 3rd point. How do you reduce the factors or weights? Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example for this, you went to the barber and the barber cut your hair in a way that you don\u0026rsquo;t like. How would you react? Most of us would shout at the barber, which is pretty natural because you are angry. The next time something like that happens to you, wait a second and tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;Thik hai yaar! Ho jaata hai! Jaan bujhkar thodi kiya hai usne\u0026rdquo; (Chill out man! He hasn\u0026rsquo;t done it on purpose). Next time if some kid is shouting and you get annoyed by the constant noise, tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s just a kid! Calm down man!\u0026rdquo;. Next time you eat bad tasting food, tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;Come on man! You can\u0026rsquo;t get tasty dishes all the time, you\u0026rsquo;ve get to eat this some day!\u0026rdquo; Trying to calm yourself down in such small situations will train your mind to react in that way more and more. That\u0026rsquo;s step one, eliminating small, easily removable factors. There are some factors that you cannot ignore right away, for example, jealousy or FOMO, try to reduce their weight on your mind. This won\u0026rsquo;t happen immediately, it will take some time. But with proper evaluation of your own mind, you will eventually be able to eliminate those factors or at least reduce the force by which they pull your mind, or the weight. But to eliminate those factors, you will first need to know them. Most of the people don\u0026rsquo;t even know what factors affect them. How do we get to know them? By self evaluation. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not as hard as it sounds. We just need to honestly reflect on things we think or how we react when we don\u0026rsquo;t have time to react.\nSo now with that we now know what is never ending happiness and if not reach there, at least start in the right direction. So that\u0026rsquo;s it for the topic \u0026lsquo;The Secret to Never Ending Happiness\u0026rsquo;. Hope you gained some value from it and enjoyed it. Signing off, until the next one.

Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the discussion as promised, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the the biggest pleasures you experience in life.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example of arguably the biggest happiness a person experiences in their whole lifetime, the birth of their child. Now you would say how would the state of mind affect the person\u0026rsquo;s ability to be happy in a scenario like that. There is no way a person can\u0026rsquo;t be happy on the birth of their child.\nNow you, the reader, if you are reading this blog, chances are that you are a modern, progressive person who is liberal and unorthodox. Let\u0026rsquo;s think of the same scenario of the birth of a child with two perspectives. The first perspective, your own perspective, imagine you holding your first child for the first time. Imagine the emotions you would be going through. The feeling that I can do anything for this child. The feeling of immense love and joy. This is the happiest you have ever been. The second scenario, the perspective a person who believes that girl child is a curse for the family, a boy child is a blessing. Now if a girl child is born and you are holding your daughter for the first time, you will be happy, but the person who does not want a girl child will be sad and angry. I am not discussing on whether the thought process of the person is right or wrong in this blog. I am just saying that this 2nd person does not feel happy about a daughter being born. Same situation, different people, different state of minds, different results in terms of happiness.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider another example, getting your first job. That is a big happiness as well, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Is everyone happy with the first job they get? No. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a salary of 12 lakh (1.2 million) INR per annum. This is a pretty good salary package for a fresher in India. Some people will be really happy getting that package because earning 1 lakh a month is kind of a big deal in India. But other people might not be as happy with the same 1 lakh per month because they think they deserve more. Once again, same situation, different people, different state of mind, different results in terms of happiness. That should be sufficient evidence to understand that even for the biggest pleasures experienced in life, we can be unhappy, it completely depends on the state of mind irrespective of the situation, whether the person will be happy or not.\nWe discussed that the happiness that we get from achieving something big, from small things like eating a chocolate, from big things like child birth are all solely dependent on the state of mind, all the other types of happiness lie on a spectrum, the farthest ends of which are the smallest and the largest pleasures we experience and you will find that for any of them, the only thing that matters is the state of mind.\nAll of that out of the way, it\u0026rsquo;s now coming together, let\u0026rsquo;s address the main topic of the blog, the title, the secret to never ending happiness! What do you need for never ending happiness? As you might\u0026rsquo;ve guessed already, a happy state of mind, always. You\u0026rsquo;d be like, \u0026lsquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the most ridiculous thing someone has ever said to me. How can someone be in a happy state of mind always? How is that person even a person if he can stay in the same state of mind always! How is that person different from a robot?\u0026rsquo;\nI agree to your point, but what if I tell you that there are people, on earth, that are practicing this, at least to some extent, on a daily basis? You\u0026rsquo;d obviously disagree. Now I am about to make a statement that is controversial, most of you might not agree with it, but let me say it outright! Religious monks are the happiest people on the planet. You\u0026rsquo;d go like \u0026lsquo;Ah! Here we go again! Another andh bhakt (blind devotee)\u0026rsquo;. I understand your reaction to this statement, but I do have good reasons to believe this. And as you might\u0026rsquo;ve guessed again, that along with the secret to our happiness and its relation to placebo will be covered in the next part of this series.\nThat was the part 4 of the blog, a short one, ended on a controversial, note. Please check out part 5 where I justify my statement. Until then, Ta-Ta.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-secret-to-never-ending-happiness-4/","summary":"This is the 4th part in my series, The Secret to Never Ending Happiness.

If you are here for the first time, please make sure to check out the part 1 and part 2 and then come back here. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the discussion as promised, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the really small pleasures that you experience in life.\nFor some time, let\u0026rsquo;s forget the placebo effect and focus on the state of mind. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a situation where you are eating your favourite chocolate. It is a delightful experience, you are enjoying the chocolate. Is this a happiness? Yes. Would you say this kind of happiness has nothing to do with the state of mind? The type of happiness we talked about earlier was naturally very easy to relate with the state of mind, but this one is a bit difficult. You would say who thinks so much while eating a chocolate. We eat it, we enjoy it, and we forget about it. And yes, you are absolutely correct. But within the next few minutes, I will prove it to you that it is the state of mind and nothing else in this situation as well that makes you feel happy.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider two scenarios, 1st, the scenario where you are eating the chocolate and this is your first chocolate, you enjoyed it, you experienced happiness. The second scenario, you are eating the same chocolate, but this is your 10th back to back. Would you feel the same pleasure that you felt while having the first chocolate? Is your state of mind while having the 1st chocolate and the 10th chocolate the same? No. Since your state of mind is different, you don\u0026rsquo;t feel happy while having the 10th chocolate. You might argue that eating 10 chocolates is also a situation not the state of mind, it is the situation that\u0026rsquo;s causing the unpleasant feeling and not the state of mind. To that I would say, let\u0026rsquo;s consider an imaginary scenario where a person eats 10 chocolates but his memory about eating the chocolate is wiped out after eating every chocolate, won\u0026rsquo;t he feel the same pleasure on the 10th chocolate as the 1st one?\nThe situation is still the same here, the person eating 10 chocolates, but since the situation is not affecting the state of mind, the same happiness can be experienced again and again. Can the situation influence the state of mind? Of course yes, but the state of mind is the sole decider of whether the person will be happy or not given a particular situation. But you would argue that this is an imaginary scenario, how can I base my arguments on something that isn\u0026rsquo;t even real? Then let me give you a real example. Will each and every person in the entire world agree that your favourite chocolate is the best chocolate in the world? No. Why? Because not every person in the world finds that chocolate as tasty as you find. Why so? Because every person has different tastes. Where are those tastes developed from? Their past experiences. What a person\u0026rsquo;s state of mind will be in a given situation is defined by his past experiences of similar situations. Their state of mind will define how they will react to the same situation of eating a chocolate.\nLet me give you another example from my own life. I am Jain and I hate eating cucumber. Recently I was on a vacation in Sikkim and finding Jain food there was a really challenging task. They used to cook the same food everyday and I was really bored of it. So I was hungry, we were outside the hotel we were staying in and a lady was sitting there with a stall where she was selling a variety of fruits and vegetables. She used to slice those vegetables put chat masala and salt on it and sell it. I ate cucumber there and really liked it. Now the people who know me well know that I would never eat cucumber, I just hate the taste of it. But the state of mind I was in, I really enjoyed eating it. You would again argue that the situation led to this. I would counter that with this. Our mind is the reason we tend to overeat when the food is very tasty even when we are full and our mind is the reason we stay hungry even when we know we want more food but the food does not taste good. It is when we are very hungry, our mind says that this is the limit of staying hungry, that\u0026rsquo;s when we decide to eat something we don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy. The ultimate decider is our mind and not our stomach. I have seen people staying hungry for 30 days straight surviving just on boiled water in my religion. Whether it is correct to do so or not is a topic for another blog, but the ability to do so, where does it come from? It is solely the mind.\nThat, I feel is sufficient evidence to prove that even in really small pleasures we experience in life, it is the state of mind and solely the state of mind that decides whether we will be happy given the situation or not. The situation and our past experiences influence the state of mind we are in, but they cannot directly control what we feel whenever we experience that situation. This again relates to the previous blog where I described at length about how I was blaming the situation rather than improving myself.\nNow, you would argue about the kinds of happiness that are overwhelming, the happiness of becoming a parent for example, can a person be sad in such a situation as well? These situations make you forget every sadness you have, they just fill you with immense pleasure, how can state of mind possibly stop a person from being happy in such situations? How can such happiness be dependent on the state of mind? To find the answer to that, stay tuned for the part 4 of this blog series. Hope you enjoyed this one, until then, Ta-Ta.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-secret-to-never-ending-happiness-3/","summary":"This is the 3rd part in my series, The Secret to Never Ending Happiness.

If you are here for the first time, please make sure to check out the part 1 and then come back here. At the end of part 1, we discussed about one kind of happiness, the happiness of bouncing back from all odds and we compared it to the placebo effect. We took the analogy of a depression patient in case of placebo effect and a cricketer in case of the happiness of bouncing back. Where the cricketer corresponds to the patient, the depression corresponds to lack of form. Medication given in placebo effect corresponds to the mental therapy that the cricketer took. And we concluded that overall as a process, this was quite similar to placebo effect. Overall it was the same thing, it is all about conditioning your mind to believe that the situation you are in is curable. Once you are able to successfully condition your mind, irrespective of the method you take to condition your mind, which in case of placebo was a fake medicine, and in case of cricket was therapy and time away, happiness is guaranteed.\nWe ended the last part with a question, a question that was less about placebo effect and more about conditioning your mind. If an unemployed person convinces himself to stay happy irrespective of whether he has a job or not, is it a good thing? Obviously it is not a good thing. But is this the kind of mind conditioning I am talking about? Is the unemployed person actually happy? Even if the person is happy, how long will he stay that way? Is his family happy? This kind of happiness is generally very short term and \u0026rsquo;taking comfort from blaming the situation\u0026rsquo; kind of happiness. You might\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of people who do that. You yourself might have done that in your life in some part or the other. I will give you my own example. 5 years ago, I appeared for the JEE Mains examination. I was nervous, when I sat in the exam hall, I saw that there was no wall clock available in the classroom, I was not allowed to carry a wrist watch. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, JEE is one of the toughest exams in India and it is huge for students who want to pursue engineering after class 12. The exam has 90 questions to solve in 3 hours, i.e., 2 minutes per question, that is how I used to time all my mock exams and I absolutely needed a watch at that time.\nSince I had a habit of looking at the watch every minute in the exam, I was very tensed, I was borderline devastated. I thought it was over, I am not going to be able to finish my paper in time. And it happened as expected, it did not go well for me. I cleared the exam but not with good marks. I obviously had the option to ask time to the supervisor, but how many times? I had a habit of checking it every minute and timing every question. I came out and cursed the center a lot for not keeping a wall clock in the classroom. I told every single person who asked me that it was not my fault that the exam did not go well. It was because I did not get a stupid watch. But what was it actually? Deep down, I knew that it was my own lack of preparation that led to the situation. If not wall clock, I would have had some other excuse for the bad performance. I was comforting my own mind by blaming the situation and conditioning my own mind into thinking that it was not my fault. Yes it was not my fault that I did not get a watch, but it was my fault that I did not prepare good enough for the exam.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one more example from my own life, one of my biggest fears, swimming. Since childhood, I have always hated swimming, because I cannot figure out how to do it. A few years back, one of my friends told me that he is joining swimming coaching classes and he invited me as well. It was the month of December and my college vacations were going on. I thought let\u0026rsquo;s give it one more try. I tried, and I failed. I tried for 3-4 days continuously and I failed again and again. On the fifth day when my friend called me, I thought of the best thing that could comfort my mind, \u0026lsquo;it is really cold outside\u0026rsquo;. For context, I live in Mumbai, India, where even the lowest temperatures don\u0026rsquo;t go below 20°C. But since I wanted some or the other reason to avoid swimming (i.e. my fear), I found it in the form of Mumbai winters. It was not even on purpose. I literally comforted my own mind by blaming a situation that is not even a blocker. It might seem a bit silly, but everyone of us do this in some or the other form or some or the other situation. The unemployed person is doing the same thing.\nMost of the people who say they are happy of the adverse situation are happy because they have convinced their mind to stay in the comfort zone of blaming the situation and not taking up the charge themselves. Even after knowing all of this, it is very difficult for us to come out of the trap of blaming the situation. Actual happiness is not in comforting yourself by blaming the situation, actual happiness is in accepting your own flaws, working on them and beating them.\nThe above discussion was a rather short one and might seem like a tangent from the main discussion that was going on about the different kinds of happiness, state of mind and the placebo effect but I thought that it is important to highlight it when talking about the winning kind of happiness. It was especially important to highlight what kind of mind comforting or mind conditioning I am not talking about. In the next blog, we will move on to a totally different kind of happiness, a really small kind of happiness, let\u0026rsquo;s say you ate your favourite chocolate and you are happy. Do check out part 3 where I discuss about the same.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-secret-to-never-ending-happiness-2/","summary":"This is the 2nd part in my series, The Secret to Never Ending Happiness.

We took the analogy of a depression patient in case of placebo effect and a cricketer in case of the happiness of bouncing back.","title":"The Secret to Never Ending Happiness - Part 2"},{"content":"Let me directly break this to you. The secret to never ending happiness can be understood by the concept of the placebo effect. Yes! You read it right. I can already hear you scream at your screen that what the hell am I talking about! How can happiness be a placebo effect. Yes, I know you have experienced happiness for real, it is not fake like the placebo effect. Just hear me out once. It is not as direct as you think\nFor those who don\u0026rsquo;t know what a placebo effect is, it is a very widely known phenomenon in clinical psychology. Various tests have shown that if a patient who is suffering from depression, anxiety, fatigue, etc. are given a fake medicine or a fake drug without telling the patient, i.e. the patient thinks that they are being treated with the real medicine. And the results in many of the cases have been on the positive side, the patients have reported reduced depression, stress, fatigue due to the so called \u0026ldquo;medicine\u0026rdquo;. Just because they think that they are being treated, they actually start showing healing signs.\nNow you would say how is it related to happiness, it is just something used in clinical psychology, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Okay let me explain this with a real life example that I myself have experienced. I remember I was in my 2nd or 3rd standard and all my other friends and cousins who were the same age as me had learnt how to ride a bicycle. I was late, I still used to ride the bicycle with the training wheels on and I felt very humiliated every time my parents compared me with my cousins or friends. Even my friends used to mock me because at that time knowing how to ride a bicycle was the \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo; thing for us and I was not able to ride the bicycle no matter how much I tried. I used to be scared everytime my mother would take me to the ground to ride the bicycle. Because it had almost become a norm at that time (at least in my mind), that I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to drive the bicycle without the training wheels and I\u0026rsquo;ll fall down and get hurt and come back home crying.\nNow one day, my mother told me to take my bicycle with me to the ground. I, as usual, was scared and pleaded her to not leave my bicycle and hold on to it from the back while I try to balance it without the training wheels. She agreed to that. I started pedaling, my mother was holding the bicycle from the back and protecting me from falling. I kept on riding the bicycle for 5 minutes straight. Then I stopped and looked behind. I was surprised to find that my mother was not holding on to the bicycle, I rode the bicycle by myself, I asked my mother how long did I ride it on my own. She said that she had left the cycle after walking 8-10 steps after that I was on my own the whole time. I was so shocked after listening to it. My 8-9 year old brain wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to comprehend what I had done. I was in awe, but was very happy. Because I knew that there is hope that I will be able to learn how to ride a bicycle.\nThis was a placebo effect. Here my mother pretending to hold the bicycle was like the fake medicine and I was like a patient going through an illness of not being able to drive a bicycle. This example may seem petty but if we think about it, many of the problems we face in life are so similar to this. In this particular example, it was not my inability to ride a bicycle that was a hurdle for me to learn it, it was my mind. Mind is a funny thing, it plays games with you. It is so difficult to control your mind, to take command of your mind. A student who is not being able to score good marks fails again and again because he or she has completely made up their mind that they can never score good marks, that they are dumb. People who are really successful tend to get carried away by success. Students who are toppers consistently stay toppers because they are confident of their ability of scoring marks. Even in sports, for example in cricket, if a batsman is not scoring runs, he consistently fails to score runs, a batsman who is within the runs, consistently keeps on scoring big runs, there is no question about the ability of the batsman who is not amongst the runs, it is just the state of mind they are in. There are countless examples in each and every phase of life where what state of mind you are in decides whether you will be happy or not.\nNow happiness is of multiple types. One could be the really small happiness, let\u0026rsquo;s say you ate your favourite chocolate, that is a happiness, let\u0026rsquo;s say you won the employee of the month award, that is a happiness, let\u0026rsquo;s say you are a to be parent and you hear the news for the first time, that is a happiness. Each of these examples make you happy but the magnitudes are different. One by one in the subsequent blogs of this series, I will explain that irrespective of the magnitude, type or situation, the state of mind is the main factor that decides whether you are happy or not. I will one by one compare each of these kinds of happiness to the placebo effect. First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the happiness of bouncing back from a position where your mind is just hopeless and then winning, irrespective of your age, field or phase of life. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider the earlier example of a cricketer who is not scoring runs. The batsman is completely out of wits, and he is going through a very bad phase in his career. What does he do? He takes rest, spends time with family, takes mental therapy, improves his state of mind, comes back fresh, in confidence and ready to score big runs from the first ball. And he does so as well. It is the change in state of mind that led to this happiness.\nSomeone would argue that although being in a good state of mind leads to happiness, how is it a placebo effect? Placebo effect is about faking the comforting feeling. It is like faking in front of a batsman that he has been scoring 100s from the last 5 games. But that is not how it works right? The batsman knows that he hasn\u0026rsquo;t scored runs. Yes, that is correct. That is a perfectly valid argument, but are we actually faking that the batsman has scored 100s? Think about it, in the placebo effect, are we actually faking that the patient does not have depression? In this case, that depression is lack of runs. We are not running away from the fact that the batsman is not scoring runs, we need something like a fake medicine that convinces that batsman to actually gain confidence and then let that confidence (or the body itself in case of placebo effect) do the job. Again you might argue that the medicine in placebo effect was fake, here the cricketer is actually working on his mental health. Again, that is a valid argument. But let\u0026rsquo;s take a step back and think. Aren\u0026rsquo;t those two the same thing? It is basically conditioning your mind to achieve a purpose. I remember the famous dialogue from the movie 3 idiots, where Aamir Khan says \u0026ldquo;Aal izz well\u0026rdquo;, and explains the logic behind it, it is not about solving the problem, it is about convincing your mind that you will be able to solve it. Although the way it is achieved is different, it is exactly the same thing. Happiness in case of bouncing back from a situation is basically the placebo effect. This kind of happiness is the easiest to compare with placebo effect and has the most direct relationship. In the subsequent blogs, we will get into some of the more complicated ones that are kind of difficult to relate to a placebo.\nBut this raises a serious concern. If happiness is all about mindset, then let\u0026rsquo;s consider an example where this could go wrong. If let\u0026rsquo;s say a person isn\u0026rsquo;t getting a job, and he says that he is happy with his life right now and does not need a job. He is satisfied with his life and lacks the hunger to crack an interview and get into a job. Do you think that\u0026rsquo;s okay? Do you think convincing your mind to be satisfied with the adverse situation of being jobless helping the person here? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so! Do check out the part 2 of this blog to know the answer to this, hope you enjoyed this one!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-secret-to-never-ending-happiness-1/","summary":"Let me directly break this to you.

Just hear me out once.","title":"The Secret to Never Ending Happiness - Part 1"},{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the first, second and third part, I would recommend you to first check those out and then come back here to read the part 4:\nTeacher: Good morning students!\nStudents: Good morning teacher!\nTeacher: Last time, Rajat had asked about rituals, let\u0026rsquo;s continue that discussion.\nRajat: Yes! I am fed up of my parents telling me to perform so many religious rituals.\nSrushti: Yes, me too! I am tired of doing pooja everyday.\nJainam: My parents force me to wear dhoti while performing rituals. That is so difficult to wear! It is so uncomfortable as well.\nIqbal: I also would like to know the reason why my parents tell me to offer namaaz 5 times a day.\nTeacher: Why do we all link rituals so closely to religion? It is essential to understand that rituals are not just religious rituals. We, in our minds, have associated rituals so closely to religion, that we have lost the ability to distinguish between the two.\nRajat: I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, can you elaborate? How are the two different. I think that rituals are a part of religion that we have to follow, no questions asked.\nTeacher: That\u0026rsquo;s where most people falter. Let me give you an example, yesterday was Aagam\u0026rsquo;s birthday right?\nAagam: Yes!\nTeacher: You had fun?\nAagam: Yes! A lot! 5 students from our class had come to surprise me with a cake! I cut the cake, we played some games, we danced, it was a lot of fun!\nTeacher: Yes! You cut a cake! Exactly my point! Why do we cut a cake when it is someone\u0026rsquo;s birthday? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a ritual?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say a boy loves a girl, why does a boy sit on his knee and give a rose to the girl? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a ritual? Why is it an implication that a boy loves a girl if he gives her a rose sitting on one knee?\nYou see my point, don\u0026rsquo;t you Rajat? Rituals are everywhere around us, a lot of the things we do in our daily lives are rituals and we don\u0026rsquo;t even realize that while doing it. Rituals are not a religious phenomenon. A boy proposing with a rose is a way of letting the girl know that how much the boy loves her. It is just a way to express your feeling to someone or something. Even a birthday cake is a way of celebrating the life lived by the birthday boy or girl until that point in time. There are many more examples. Can someone else give any other such example?\nJimit: Yes! I have one! They give \u0026lsquo;Ikkis topo ki salaami\u0026rsquo; (21 canon salute), when a brave soldier or a well respected person in the country dies.\nAagam: I have one more, after a person dies, in Hindu culture, their body is burnt, in Christain and Muslim culture, they are buried in the graveyard.\nTeacher: Correct! Let\u0026rsquo;s treat rituals as rituals and not associate rituals so closely to religion. That\u0026rsquo;s the first point I wanted to clear. Now the 2nd point, what about religious rituals? Does anyone have anything to share about religious rituals specifically?\nKenan: I feel that not all religious rituals are bad. While performing many of the rituals, there is an aura of positivity around us. For example in Diwali, don\u0026rsquo;t you feel great with all the Rangolis and Diyas and firecrackers and sweets and people meeting each other? In Christmas, don\u0026rsquo;t you feel Christmas tree, Santa Claus, gifts, decorations are a great way to celebrate something?\nRajat: Even I enjoy these festivals and I celebrate those because I enjoy them, but there are so many rituals that I do not enjoy, and I am forced to perform, what about them?\nTeacher: Remember our discussion from the last lecture? Ask the right questions to the right people, ask the meaning of these rituals to the people who actually know them. As already established, rituals are everywhere and every ritual has a special meaning, there have to be meanings of these poojas and namaaz and roza and fasting and which food to eat and which not to eat, ask questions, know the answers, if you like the answer, follow that ritual, if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, don\u0026rsquo;t follow it, as simple as that.\nI agree with the point that there are rituals that do not make sense, but there are many rituals for which we don\u0026rsquo;t know the reason and we have never tried to understand it.\nRajat: Got it! But what about those mantras, chants, shlokas, etc. that people just keep on speaking without even knowing the meaning of them?\nTeacher: There are definite benefits to the mantras even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the meaning of them. You might have noticed that all the people who recite them do so while meditating. And I don\u0026rsquo;t need to explain you the benefits of meditation. Those shlokas are a way of getting all the other things out of your mind and attain a perfect state of meditation. Attaining that is a very difficult task. So even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the meaning, they can help you in increasing your concentration, focus, etc. and thousand other things that meditation helps with.\nTeacher: I believe that everyone has all the answers they wanted about religion. Am I right?\nStudents: Yes!\nTeachers: Let\u0026rsquo;s conclude this discussion by summarizing everything we discussed in the last 4 lectures:\nEven if we don\u0026rsquo;t know whether God exists or not, there are definite benefits of believing in God because it helps you to stay level headed in the best as well as worst phases of your life. We don\u0026rsquo;t care whether paap, punya, heaven, hell exists or not as long as they lead us to do the good things in life and become a good person. We can\u0026rsquo;t believe everything in religion blindly because it could be tampered with, distorted or biased. Reasoning is the most important lesson we have learnt. Fake babas, terrorism, riots that are caused because of religion is not because of religion, it is because of how humans misuse it, religion is a tool, and we are the users of that tool. Both science and religion have their own set of advantages and disadvantages like every other thing in the world. Both atheists and theists are right and wrong simultaneously. Atheists are right to ask the questions but are wrong to ask them to the wrong people and theists are right to follow religion but are wrong to follow religion blindly. I would like to conclude this discussion by saying that both science and religion need to coexist, both are absolutely essential for the existence of human kind. (Bell rings)\nTeacher: Thankyou everyone!\nI hope you enjoyed this mini series on religion and have got a different perspective on how to think about religion as a whole. In this series I have tried to cover only the things that we witness in our daily lives and the things that matter to us. There are many bigger things like politics going on within the religious communities, etc. But for us common people, those things do not matter as much as the things mentioned in this series in my opinion. Will be back with a new topic in the next blog, until then, goodbye!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-wrong-about-religion-4/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the first, second and third part, I would recommend you to first check those out and then come back here to read the part 4:\nTeacher: Good morning students!\nStudents: Good morning teacher!\nTeacher: Last time, Rajat had asked about rituals, let\u0026rsquo;s continue that discussion.\nRajat: Yes!

Jimit had asked us about the fake babas and gurus.\nJimit: Yes, I am of the opinion that paap, punya, heaven and hell are misused by these babas to fool innocent people. I am strongly against that. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen so many cases where these babas have almost a cult like following and support from the people. They have connections with big politicians, they commit crimes and never get caught. How would you defend that? You have to agree that the root cause for all of this is religion.\nTeacher: Good point Jimit! I will come to that point in a second. Before that, you answer me a few questions.\nSince you are obviously anti-religion here, it is safe to assume that you are a believer in science. You believe that everything that exists, everything that is discovered or will be discovered, everything that is invented has a logical explanation that science will one day figure out. There are no questions that science cannot answer, given enough time. Am I correct?\nJimit: Yes, absolutely!\nTeacher: Do you believe that science, scientific and technological progress is a boon to the society?\nJimit: Yes.\nTeacher: Good. Now how many of you know about Alfred Nobel?\nRajat: He is the person whom the Nobel prize is named after.\nTeacher: Yes. Do you know the story of the dynamite and Alfred Nobel?\nRajat: Yes, he was the inventor of dynamite and he once read in the newspaper that \u0026lsquo;Alfred Nobel dies because of his own invention\u0026rsquo;, he was very disturbed by the fact that dynamite is being used for war. People hated him, so he added the Nobel peace prize in his will, so people remember him for the good and not the bad.\nTeacher: Did Alfred Nobel think of this application of the dynamite while inventing it?\nRajat: No.\nTeacher: Good. Now Jimit, answer few more simple questions, do you have a knife at your home?\nJimit: Yes.\nTeacher: What do you use it for?\nJimit: To cut vegetables.\nTeacher: Can it be used to hurt someone?\nJimit: Yes.\nTeacher: Does that mean we stop using the knife?\nJimit: No.\nTeacher: Similarly, is science good? Yes. Can science be misused? Yes. All the modern weapons are a scientific invention. They are used for war. They are used to kill innocent people by terrorists. The vehicles, factories, machines, etc. we see around us is all originated from some or the other scientific invention. All of them harm the environment. Does that mean we stop all scientific research? No.\nScience, just like that knife in your house is just a tool, what matters is the way it is used. If one particular use case of that tool is not good, that does not mean that the tool is bad.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t you feel that it is the same for religion as well? In the case of fake babas, it isn\u0026rsquo;t even misuse of religion, it is straight up wrong, it is not even religion. But since they do it in the name of religion, the tool, religion is blamed.\nJimit: But that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case. Some of the rules that these religions preach, are just wrong. For example, the \u0026ldquo;sati\u0026rdquo; practice that was followed earlier where when husband dies, wife has to jump into the flames of the husband\u0026rsquo;s cremation.\nThere are many examples of such rules that are harmful at best, fatal even, at times. If religion is so ideal, how can these things exist in religion?\nTeacher: Absolutely agree! Great point! Here\u0026rsquo;s the problem with theists. Practices like \u0026ldquo;sati\u0026rdquo; are obviously bad. Any logical person would agree with that. There are many such practices prevalent in modern day as well, where people do things that are unfathomable in the name of religion. People believe in a lot of things that obviously should not exist. For the theists in the class, if there is something obviously wrong, you should not follow it blindly. It is really important to ask the right questions to the right people.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the problem with religion. Long time back when many of the religions were made, all the communication was oral, there were very less written books or scriptures that describe these religions. Anyone who has played the game \u0026lsquo;Chinese whisper\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;telephone\u0026rsquo;, knows that the messages that are passed orally get distorted so easily. Even if it does not get distorted, the person who is listening to the religious preachings might have a different opinion about the same and he goes on to preach his own opinion. Some of the religious preachings we hear today are distorted long back, some of them are lost, some of them might be logical but we don\u0026rsquo;t have reasons for them.\nSo what is the solution to this? Logical reasoning and asking the right questions as I said earlier. You ask the questions to right people, if you are satisfied with the answer you get, follow it, if you are not, don\u0026rsquo;t follow it.\nIt is important to understand that paap and punya are not absolute rules, but guidelines.\nRajat: Great point! I had another question, I have never understood why we have to follow the stupid rituals in religion. Why are people so obsessed with these rituals?\n(Bell rings)\nTeacher: I will surely answer this question too in the next lecture! Thankyou everyone!\nSo that was part 3 of this series, hope you enjoyed it, do check out part-4 as well!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-wrong-about-religion-3/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the first and second part, I would recommend you to first check those out and then come back here to read the part 3:\nTeacher: Good morning students!\nStudents: Good morning teacher!\nTeacher: Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with where we had ended in the last lecture.

Can you ask the question again Rohan?\nRohan: Yes, I had understood your point on why people pray to God, but I wanted to know why does so much illogical stuff exists, like the whole \u0026ldquo;paap\u0026rdquo;(sin) and \u0026ldquo;punya\u0026rdquo;(virtue) concept.\nTeacher: Okay, yeah! I remember it now. That is a really good question!\nIt definitely seems illogical at first, no offense to anyone who thinks it is logical, but I\u0026rsquo;ll give an analogy so that you understand my point in a better way. Let\u0026rsquo;s say there is a kid, a very young kid, may be 5-6 years old. One day, the kid throws a tantrum that he won\u0026rsquo;t go to the school. No matter how much his parents try to convince him, he won\u0026rsquo;t budge. Now, the mother of this kid gets an idea. She tells the kid that if he goes to the school, and behaves well, he will be awarded a chocolate. The kid started thinking, he had two options now, get bored in the school but get the chocolate in the end, or, don\u0026rsquo;t go to the school and play the whole day, but miss out on the chocolate. The kid\u0026rsquo;s mother started to notice the difference in the expression on the kid\u0026rsquo;s face. She added another condition. She said, \u0026ldquo;I am okay if you don\u0026rsquo;t go to school, but you will have to study for 2 hours instead! No playing till that is done!\u0026rdquo;, now the kid started to think that he does not have any option, he thought that if he goes to the school, he gets a chocolate and if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t go, he neither gets to play, nor gets the chocolate. And then he agreed to go to school.\nYou see where I am going with this, don\u0026rsquo;t you Rohan?\nRohan: Yeah, I see your point. You are trying to imply that the chocolate is \u0026ldquo;punya\u0026rdquo;; the punishment of \u0026ldquo;not being allowed to play if not going to school\u0026rdquo; is because the child, that\u0026rsquo;s us, committed a sin, a paap, by not going to the school. It is something like the heaven and hell concept in religion as well, where if we perform good actions, i.e., punya, we go to heaven, i.e., we get a chocolate; and if we fail to perform it, we get a punishment, i.e., we go to hell.\nTeacher: Exactly! Now tell me, why do laws exist?\nRohan: Laws exist so that people have fear while committing crimes.\nTeacher: We humans are like that kid. We tend to do a lot of wrong things if we don\u0026rsquo;t have the fear of anyone punishing us. I am not talking about big crimes either. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you an example. A lot of us, jump the signal while driving if the officer is not looking. That\u0026rsquo;s a very small example, but we always need to be bound by something, we always need to have a fear of punishment to keep ourselves from doing the wrong things.\nRohan: I understand your point. But that does not mean that we make up stuff that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even exist and mislead people. There\u0026rsquo;s no proof to this paap, punya, heaven, hell stuff. Apart from that, we are not kids that don\u0026rsquo;t understand what we are being told. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it a bit unreasonable to consider all human beings to be like that kid who does not understand what is good and what is bad. I feel that all adult humans have their own preferences, thoughts and opinions and is capable of recognizing what is good and what is bad for him or her.\nTeacher: Sure, sure! That is one way of looking at it. And I must tell you, you have given a lot of thought to this, I applaud your reasoning skills!\nNow the answer to your question. It is human nature to be curious, to want an answer to everything. That is a really good quality to have. But that also has a downside. We simply cannot accept the fact that somethings could be beyond our understanding. By no means I am saying that God exists and we simply can\u0026rsquo;t understand that he exists. I am simply stating that just because this paap, punya, heaven, hell concept does not seem logical to us right now, does not mean that it is false. Remember, almost every big breakthrough in science felt illogical at some stage of human evolution journey. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I completely agree with your point. All this could be complete nonsense. But I also don\u0026rsquo;t deny the possibility of it being true, however illogical it may seem right now.\nRather I think of it this way, if this whole paap, punya, heaven, hell concept makes you do the right things and helps you avoid doing the wrong things, what is wrong with it? I just accept the fact that I can\u0026rsquo;t figure out whether it is true or not. So rather than breaking your heads on thinking about it, just go with the flow!\n(A student named Jimit raises his hand)\nTeacher: And I am already sensing the next question that is coming my way. Please continue.\nJimit: I agree that many of the times, punya means good thing and paap means bad thing, but still, there is a lot of negativity that the so called fake babas and gurus spread in the name of the same paap, punya, heaven and hell. Do you think that is true? I heard yesterday that a person gave away a diamond ring to a baba just because he told, \u0026ldquo;punya milega\u0026rdquo;, if you do this. Do you think that is good?\n(Bell rings)\nTeacher: Oh man! What timing again! It was starting to heat up. Okay Jimit, I will surely answer this question too in the next lecture! Thankyou everyone!\nSo that was part 2 of this series, hope you enjoyed it, do check out part-3 as well!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/you-are-wrong-about-religion-2/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s continue the story from where we had left off, if you have missed the part-1, I would recommend you to first check that out and then come back here to read the part 2:\nTeacher: Good morning students!\nStudents: Good morning teacher!\nTeacher: I hope everyone remembers that we had started a debate in the last lecture, as far as I recall, Rohan had asked a question in the end which wasn\u0026rsquo;t answered because the bell rang.","title":"You Are WRONG About Religion - Part 2"},{"content":"Whether you are on the atheist side or the theist side, you are wrong! The age old debate of science vs religion is still hot, and we all have faced it some day or another, here is my take on it in a dialogue form as a conversation between the students and teacher of a classroom:\nTeacher: Good morning students!\nStudents: Good morning teacher!\nTeacher: Let\u0026rsquo;s start the day with a prayer. Come on everyone! Join your hands, close your eyes and start repeating after me!\n(A student named Rohan is not praying along with others)\nTeacher: Rohan! I said close your eyes and join your hands and repeat after me! Don\u0026rsquo;t you understand simple instructions?\nRohan: Sorry teacher! But I don\u0026rsquo;t like praying to God.\n(There was sudden silence in the class)\nIsha (another student, sarcastically): Why? Are you God yourself? Or do you think of yourself above God?\n(Students laughing)\nRohan: See? That\u0026rsquo;s what I don\u0026rsquo;t like about God or religion in general, be it any religion. Why does everyone keep on telling us to follow religion or pray to God. There is no logic to it! Has anyone seen God? No! They are just blindly following what their elders taught them and now they expect us to blindly follow them!\n(There was a pause. Another student named Jay interrupted)\nJay: What are you saying? Are you out of your mind? You are talking about God here! At least show some respect!\nRohan: Well I can\u0026rsquo;t show respect to someone whom I have never seen or met.\n(The teacher was silent meanwhile and finally spoke)\nTeacher: Okay guys! Silence! This is a classroom! Okay Rohan, you are an atheist. Atheists are the people who do not believe in God or religion. And Jay, as far as I understand, you are a theist. That\u0026rsquo;s the opposite of atheist, i.e. they believe in the existence of God and follow all religious practices.\nA lot of theists ridicule atheists just to express their views, and vice versa, the atheists mock the theists to blindly follow religion without knowing what and why they are doing.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s do something different today, you guys can ask any questions you have about religion or God or anything related to that and I will try to answer them, let\u0026rsquo;s make this a healthy debate, shall we? Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s begin with Rohan, you can ask any question you want, you do not need to worry about anything, just ask. And let me make one thing clear, atheists are very logical people that think the correct way and ask the correct questions, it\u0026rsquo;s just that it is a very sensitive topic they talk about and hence a lot of people get offended by it. Okay Rohan, go on.\nRohan: Why do I pray to god, who is he, isn\u0026rsquo;t it senseless to dedicate your entire life to someone you don\u0026rsquo;t even know or haven\u0026rsquo;t even met once?\nTeacher: That is a very valid and logical question. I would say just keep this religion/God debate aside, just think of everyday situations you face, a very real scenario, let\u0026rsquo;s say you, despite all the efforts you made, failed an exam. You are very upset, your parents, teachers are scolding you. You need someone to talk to, whom do you go to?\nRohan: A friend. Or write it in my diary.\nTeacher: Yes, exactly! Is it necessary that the person you need, should be a real person? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider another scenario, let\u0026rsquo;s say there are 2 people, person A and person B. Both of them are very intelligent and score great marks, they grow very successful in their career. But person A is very religious. He thinks that all his accomplishments are by God\u0026rsquo;s grace, he does not take credit for any of his achievements, on the other hand, person B is proud of his achievements and is rightly so. He should be proud, but that has lead to something that is not good. He has developed ego in his mind. He thinks that he is the smartest person and can accomplish anything, and that is dangerous. So faith in God helped person A to be humble. A lot of people think, \u0026ldquo;I cannot get overconfident or egoistic\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you, seeing a lot of success and not developing an ego is the hardest task in the world! You at such a young age might feel that this is all rubbish, how can ego come into me, but that is what it is.\nSo, the point is, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to believe in God, that\u0026rsquo;s okay, but then you will need to find another way of coping with these vices of the mind, be it depression, anxiety, sadness, or the \u0026lsquo;I am on the top of the world\u0026rsquo; feeling. It\u0026rsquo;s just that believing in God, for a lot of people, is an easy way out to cope with these problems.\nRohan: Okay, accepted, you can believe in God, but there are so many other things that come with it that are so illogical and senseless.\nTeacher: Like?\nRohan: Like the whole \u0026ldquo;paap\u0026rdquo; (sin) and \u0026ldquo;punya\u0026rdquo; (virtue) concept.\n(Bell rings)\nTeacher: Oh! The lecture time is over, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s continue this discussion in the next lecture, I will surely answer your question then!\nSo this was the part 1 of the \u0026lsquo;You Are WRONG About Religion\u0026rsquo;, the slightly clickbait-y name aside, if you have reached to the end of this blog, you should surely checkout the next one, part-2.
